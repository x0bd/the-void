						<strong>👋 こんにちは</strong>, My name is{" "}
						<strong>Tinodaishe Tembo</strong> aka{" "}
						<strong>xoboid</strong>. I'm a programmer and designer
						who delights in decoding signals from the{" "}
						<strong>void</strong> through code and pixel
						experiments.
					</p>
					<p>
						My interests encompass <strong>web development</strong>,{" "}
						<strong>computer graphics</strong>, and{" "}
						<strong>terminal tools</strong>. I'm passionate about
						crafting digital experiences that are not only highly
						performant but also visually captivating. Recently, I've
						been exploring the <strong>Rust</strong> programming
						language, engaging in a wide range of projects from
						creating terminal toys to developing graphics engines,
						some of which may never see widespread use, but that's
						okay!
					</p>
					<p>
						When I'm not immersed in my computer, I enjoy spending
						time with friends or losing myself in the complex
						narratives of hard science fiction. The Three Body
						Problem Trilogy holds a special place in my heart.
						Learning <strong>Japanese</strong> has also been a
						rewarding hobby.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'm also deeply passionate about music, investing my
						time in the exploration of my synthesizers to forge
						sounds that amalgamate the enigmatic with the
						electronic.
