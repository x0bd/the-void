						👋 Hi There, I'm Tinodaishe aka xoboid, a 22-year-old
						computer science undergrad. I have a deep passion for
						bringing ideas to life through code. My interests span
						across <strong>web development</strong>,{" "}
						<strong>computer graphics</strong>, and{" "}
						<strong>creative coding</strong>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Currently I'm honing my skills in web development, with
						a keen interest to learn <strong>Rust</strong> in order
						to craft highly performant and visually appealing
						experiences. I've also begun to explore the fascinating
						world of open-source software, eager to contribute and
						learn from the community.
					</p>
					<p>
						In my free time, I enjoy decoding signals from the void
						through code and pixel experiments. Outside of the
						computer realm, I usually spend time with friends,
						immersing myself in the intricate narratives of hard
						science fiction, and creating music that oscillates
						between the dark and synthetic.{" "}
